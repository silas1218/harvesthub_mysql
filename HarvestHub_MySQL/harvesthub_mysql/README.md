# HarvestHub — Phase 3 Prototype (MySQL)

A working slice of HarvestHub covering public registration (with admin
approval), login, all three role dashboards (Administrator, Garden
Coordinator, Community Gardener), and the Produce Exchange Board — now
running on a real MySQL database, matching Section IX of the paper, so
it's ready to deploy on real hosting.

The visual design (forest-green + earthy brown palette, Fraunces/Inter
font pairing, hairline-divider cards instead of shadowed boxes) takes
cues from [pacificag.com](https://pacificag.com/) and is applied
consistently across every page.

## Setting up the database

The schema and demo data live in **`schema.sql`** at the project root.
You import this **once** — after that, `db.php` just connects to the
database that already exists; nothing is created or migrated at
runtime anymore.

### XAMPP (local)
1. Start Apache **and MySQL** from the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Open `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.
3. Click **Import** → choose `schema.sql` → click **Go**.
   This creates the `harvesthub` database with all 11 tables and the
   demo accounts/sample data.
4. `db_config.php` already matches XAMPP's defaults (host `localhost`,
   user `root`, empty password) — no editing needed for local use.

### Real hosting (later)
1. Create a MySQL database through your host's control panel (cPanel,
   Plesk, etc.) and note the host, database name, username, and
   password they give you.
2. Import `schema.sql` through their phpMyAdmin (or
   `mysql -u USER -p DBNAME < schema.sql` if you have shell/SSH access).
   Note: most hosts auto-prefix database/user names — if so, remove
   the `CREATE DATABASE` / `USE` lines at the top of `schema.sql` and
   import directly into the database they created for you.
3. Edit **`db_config.php`** with the real host/dbname/user/password.
4. Upload everything and point your domain at the `public/` folder
   (this is your document root — `db.php` and `schema.sql` should sit
   one level above it, not inside it).

## How to run it locally

### Option A — PHP's built-in server
```
cd public
php -S localhost:8000
```
Open `http://localhost:8000/login.php`.

### Option B — XAMPP
1. Copy the whole `harvesthub` folder (not just `public`) into
   `htdocs` (e.g. `C:\xampp\htdocs\harvesthub`).
2. Complete the database setup above.
3. Start Apache from the XAMPP Control Panel.
4. Open `http://localhost/harvesthub/public/login.php`.

## Demo accounts

All demo accounts use the password `demo1234`.

| Role | Email |
|---|---|
| System Administrator | admin@harvesthub.test |
| Garden Coordinator | coordinator@harvesthub.test |
| Community Gardener | maria@harvesthub.test (has a plot) |
| Community Gardener | jun@harvesthub.test (has a plot) |
| Community Gardener | liza@harvesthub.test (no plot yet — good for testing "apply for a plot") |

New accounts can also be created via **"Create an Account"** on the
login page — these sit as a Pending signup request until an
Administrator approves them from the Admin dashboard.

## Pages

| Page | Role | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `login.php` | Public | Role-tabbed login (Gardener / Coordinator / Admin) + link to registration |
| `register.php` | Public | Sign-up form; creates a pending request, not an account directly |
| `admin_dashboard.php` | Administrator | System stats, pending sign-up approvals, manage gardener/coordinator accounts, create coordinator accounts |
| `staff_dashboard.php` | Garden Coordinator | Approve/reject plot applications & unassignment requests, approve/reject resource requests, create/delete plots, view all plots and resource borrowers |
| `customer_dashboard.php` | Community Gardener | View/apply for/unassign a plot, log crops, request resources, the Produce Exchange Board (search/filter/sort, post & claim listings) |

## What changed in this version

- **Database engine**: SQLite → MySQL. `db.php` now just opens a PDO
  connection using the credentials in `db_config.php`; all table
  creation lives in `schema.sql`, imported once via phpMyAdmin.
- **Fixed a install-breaking bug**: the old `db.php` had a stray line
  outside any `CREATE TABLE` statement that caused a fatal SQL syntax
  error on any brand-new database — confirmed by testing a fresh
  install before this fix. Not an issue anymore since `schema.sql`
  replaces that runtime table-creation logic entirely.
- **Fixed a validation mismatch**: `register.php`'s city dropdown
  included all 17 Metro Manila cities/municipalities, but the
  server-side whitelist in `api.php` was missing "Pateros," causing a
  false rejection. Added.
- **Fixed MySQL-incompatible SQL**: the `all_resources` query used
  SQLite's `||` string concatenation and a two-argument `GROUP_CONCAT`
  call — neither works on MySQL. Rewritten with `CONCAT()` and
  MySQL's `GROUP_CONCAT(... SEPARATOR ...)` syntax. Also replaced
  `datetime('now')` (SQLite-only) with `NOW()`.

## Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with `password_hash()` / verified with `password_verify()`.
- Every write action re-validates on the server, independent of client-side checks.
- All SQL uses prepared PDO statements; sort order and city whitelists come from server-side constants, never interpolated user input.
- Every dashboard and every sensitive API action checks the session role (`requireRole()` for pages, `requireJsonRole()` for API actions).
- Output is escaped with `htmlspecialchars()` before storage/render to guard against XSS.
- `db_config.php` holds a real database password once you deploy — keep it out of any public repo.

## Verification

Every API action was tested end-to-end against a real MySQL instance
during development: all three role logins, listing creation/claiming,
plot application/approval/unassignment, crop logging, resource
request/approval (including the fixed `all_resources` query), plot
creation/deletion (with its occupied-plot safeguard), account
registration with every NCR city including Pateros, signup approval,
and account deletion. Data was also confirmed to persist correctly
across a database restart.
